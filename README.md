# Open MQTT to Modbus Gateway

This software is an Open Source alternative to Teltonikas' Modbus Gateway (`modbusgateway`).

It is written in C and uses the [libmodbus](https://libmodbus.org/) library. It also depends on the [libmosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/) library for MQTT communication.

This software used to be a drop-in replacement for the Teltonika Modbus Gateway software, but it has since been rewritten and is no longer compatible.

> **NOTE:** This software is not affiliated with Teltonika, and I've not seen a single line of Teltonika code.


## Background

The Teltonika RUT's `modbusgateway` software is a crucial component of the product offering at my company.

I don't know why Teltonika developed it in the first place, the requirements, or the design decisions behind it. All I know is that it doesn't (at the time of writing) support all typical Modbus functions. I raised this problem with them in February 2021, but it is still unresolved.

Instead of waiting for a fix, I created my own software to fill the gap.


## Benefits over the original software

At first, it was nothing more than a drop-in replacement for the original software, with support for the missing Modbus functions. However, with time I realised that some security layer was required to prevent unwanted commands to Modbus slaves. Along with that came the need for a rules engine to filter out unwanted requests. While I was at it, I also added support for TLS so that the software no longer needs to rely on a separate MQTT broker.

* Supports all Modbus functions
* Is open source
* Supports TLS without the need for a separate MQTT broker
* Rules engine for advanced filtering of requests


## Protocol

A `controller` publishes a message in the format below on a `request` topic. The software interprets the message and performs a Modbus request based on instructions from the message. The software then replies on the `response` topic.

### Request message

## Security

Modbus is a protocol that is not secure by default. There is no authentication or encryption in the Modbus protocol.

This software uses MQTT to relay messages to a Modbus TCP slave from the internet. MQTT is capable of being a secure protocol, but only if the MQTT broker and client both support TLS encryption.

TLS encryption is supported and tested against the [test.mosquitto.org](https://test.mosquitto.org/) broker on port 8884.

Still, even with encryption, one shouldn't just trust any message sent to the gateway. Otherwise, the gateway would blindly relay the message to the Modbus TCP slave. Even a simple misspelling of a register number could cause damage to the Modbus TCP slave.

To get around this, the gateway has built-in checks to filter out messages. A message must pass the following checks to be relayed to the Modbus TCP slave:

- CIDR check: the IP address of the request target must be within the specified CIDR range.
- Port check: the port number of the request target must be within the specified range.
- Slave ID check: the slave ID of the request must match the specified slave ID.
- Function check: the Modbus function of the request must match and be only one of the following: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 15 or 16.
- Register number check: the register number must be within the specified range.

The checks are configurable via the configuration file. The configuration file is described in the next section.


## Configuration

The config file is used to specify the settings for the application. The file must be in plain text format.

### Format

The file is divided into sections, each section starts with a `config` keyword followed by the name of the section.
Each section contains multiple options, each option is specified on a new line and starts with the `option` keyword followed by the name of the option and its value.

```text
config <section_name>
	option <option_name> '<option_value>'
	option <option_name> '<option_value>'
	...
```

Example config file:

```text
config mqtt
	option host '127.0.0.1'
	option port '1883'
	option keepalive '60'
	option username 'user'
	option password 'pass'
	option qos '0'
	option retain 'false'
	option clean_session 'true'
	option request_topic 'request'
	option response_topic 'response'
	option ca_cert_path 'cert/ca.crt'
	option cert_path 'cert/client.crt'
	option key_path 'cert/client.key'

config rule
	option ip '::ffff:127.0.0.1/128'
	option port '1502'
	option slave_id '1'
	option function '3'
	option register_address '0-65535'
